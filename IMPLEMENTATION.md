# pgcopy - Project Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented `pgcopy`, a high-performance Go CLI tool for efficiently copying data between PostgreSQL databases with identical schemas. The tool is designed for data-only migrations with optimal performance characteristics.

## Key Features Implemented

### ðŸš€ Core Functionality

- Parallel Processing: Configurable worker pools for concurrent table copying
- Batch Processing: Configurable batch sizes for memory-efficient operations
- Transaction Safety: Uses transactions to ensure data consistency
- Foreign Key Handling: Temporarily disables constraints during copy operations

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Progress

- Real-time Progress: Periodic progress updates during long-running operations
- Visual Progress Bar: schollz/progressbar integration enabled by default with sticky top position and scrolling log messages below
- Statistics Tracking: Comprehensive copy statistics with performance metrics
- Dry Run Mode: Preview operations without actual data copying

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

- Connection Strings: Direct PostgreSQL connection string support
- Configuration Files: External config file support for credentials
- Table Filtering: Include/exclude specific tables or schemas with wildcard support (`temp_*`, `*_logs`)
- Flexible Parameters: Configurable parallel workers and batch sizes

### ðŸ”— Advanced Foreign Key Management

- Automatic Detection: Discovers all foreign key constraints in target tables
- Circular Dependency Handling: Resolves complex FK relationships including cycles
- Smart Strategy Selection: Uses replica mode when available, falls back to drop/recreate
- Safe Restoration: Guarantees FK restoration even after operation failures
- Non-Superuser Support: Works without special database privileges

### ðŸ“‹ Commands Implemented

1. `copy` - Main data copying functionality with FK management
2. `list` - List tables with row counts and sizes
3. `version` - Display version information
4. `help` - Comprehensive help system

### Key Components

#### 1. CLI Framework (Cobra)

- Command-line argument parsing
- Subcommand structure
- Help system generation
- Configuration management with Viper

#### 2. Database Connection Management

- PostgreSQL driver integration (`lib/pq`)
- Connection pooling optimization
- Connection string and file-based configuration
- Error handling and validation

#### 3. Parallel Processing Engine

- Worker pool implementation
- Channel-based work distribution
- Concurrent table processing
- Error collection and reporting

#### 4. Data Transfer Logic

- Batch-based copying for memory efficiency
- Primary key or ctid-based ordering for consistency
- Transaction-based operations
- Progress tracking and statistics

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Level

- Connection Pooling: Optimized connection pool sizes
- Foreign Key Constraints: Temporarily disabled during copy
- Transaction Batching: Batch inserts within transactions
- Ordered Pagination: Primary key-based ordering for consistent results

### Application Level

- Parallel Workers: Configurable worker pools (default: 4)
- Batch Size: Configurable batch sizes (default: 1000)
- Memory Management: Efficient memory usage with streaming
- Progress Updates: Throttled progress reporting (every 5 seconds)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Copy

```bash
pgcopy copy \
  --source "postgres://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --dest "postgres://user:pass@dest:5432/db"
```

### High Performance Copy

```bash
pgcopy copy \
  --source "postgres://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --dest "postgres://user:pass@dest:5432/db" \
  --parallel 16 \
  --batch-size 10000
```

### Selective Copy

```bash
pgcopy copy \
  --source "postgres://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --dest "postgres://user:pass@dest:5432/db" \
  --include "users,orders,products"
```

### Table Listing

```bash
pgcopy list --source "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db"
```

```bash
pgcopy copy \
  --source "postgres://user:pass@source:5432/db" \

```bash
pgcopy copy \
  --source "postgres://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --dest "postgres://user:pass@dest:5432/db" \
  --no-progress
